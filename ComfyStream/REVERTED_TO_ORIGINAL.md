# ComfyStream Plugin - Reverted to Original Version

## ✅ **COMPLETE REVERT COMPLETED**

I've reverted everything back to the original working version from the beginning of our chat. All the problematic changes have been removed.

### 🔄 **What I Reverted**

1. **FComfyStreamConfig Struct**
   - ✅ Removed all problematic new properties (`ImageFilename`, `ImagePath`, `PollingFrequency`)
   - ✅ Restored original simple struct with only essential properties
   - ✅ Removed migration functions and complex initialization

2. **ComfyImageFetcher Implementation**
   - ✅ Restored original `/history` endpoint (instead of `/view`)
   - ✅ Restored original JSON response processing
   - ✅ Restored original 1-second polling interval
   - ✅ Removed all hardcoded values and struct dependencies

3. **ComfyStreamActor**
   - ✅ Removed migration function calls
   - ✅ Restored original simple initialization

### 🎯 **Current State (Original Version)**

- **Endpoint**: `/history` (returns JSON data)
- **Polling**: 1 second intervals
- **Response**: JSON processing (not image data)
- **Struct**: Simple, stable configuration
- **No Crashes**: Should compile and run without issues

### 🚀 **How to Test**

1. **Clean and compile:**
   - Close Unreal Editor
   - Delete `Binaries/`, `Intermediate/`, `Saved/`
   - Delete `Plugins/ComfyStream/Binaries/`, `Plugins/ComfyStream/Intermediate/`
   - Regenerate project files
   - Compile in Visual Studio

2. **Test in Unreal Editor:**
   - Create a ComfyStreamActor
   - Set server URL to your ComfyUI server
   - Press Play
   - Check logs for JSON response (not images)

### 📋 **Expected Behavior (Original)**

- ✅ **No compilation crashes**
- ✅ **No struct warnings**
- ✅ **Plugin loads successfully**
- ✅ **Polls `/history` endpoint every second**
- ✅ **Receives JSON data from ComfyUI**
- ⚠️ **No image display** (this was the original issue)

### 🔧 **Next Steps**

The plugin is now back to its original, stable state. If you want to implement the ChatGPT rule properly, we should:

1. **First ensure this version compiles and runs without crashes**
2. **Then implement the `/view` endpoint changes step by step**
3. **Test each change individually to avoid crashes**

The original version should now compile and run without any crashes!
