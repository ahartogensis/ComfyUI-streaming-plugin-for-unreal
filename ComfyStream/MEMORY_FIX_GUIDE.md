# Fix Memory Issues During Compilation

## The Problem
The compilation is failing due to insufficient virtual memory (paging file). This is a Windows system issue, not a code problem.

## Error Details
- `c1xx: error C3859: Failed to create virtual memory for PCH`
- `The paging file is too small for this operation to complete`
- `fatal error C1076: compiler limit: internal heap limit reached`

## Solutions (Try in Order)

### Solution 1: Increase Virtual Memory (Recommended)
1. **Open System Properties:**
   - Press `Win + R`
   - Type `sysdm.cpl` and press Enter
   - Click "Advanced" tab
   - Click "Settings" under Performance
   - Click "Advanced" tab
   - Click "Change" under Virtual memory

2. **Increase Paging File:**
   - Uncheck "Automatically manage paging file size"
   - Select your C: drive
   - Select "Custom size"
   - Set Initial size: `8192` MB (8 GB)
   - Set Maximum size: `16384` MB (16 GB)
   - Click "Set" then "OK"
   - Restart your computer

### Solution 2: Close Other Applications
1. **Close unnecessary programs:**
   - Close web browsers
   - Close other Visual Studio instances
   - Close any heavy applications
   - Keep only essential programs running

2. **Check Task Manager:**
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + Esc`
   - Look for high memory usage
   - End unnecessary processes

### Solution 3: Compile with Reduced Parallelism
1. **In Visual Studio:**
   - Go to Tools → Options
   - Projects and Solutions → Build and Run
   - Set "Maximum number of parallel project builds" to `1`
   - Click OK

2. **Or use command line:**
   ```
   msbuild Reconstruction_3D.sln /p:MaxCpuCount=1
   ```

### Solution 4: Clean Build
1. **Clean everything:**
   - Close Visual Studio and Unreal Editor
   - Delete `Binaries/` folder
   - Delete `Intermediate/` folder
   - Delete `Plugins/ComfyStream/Binaries/`
   - Delete `Plugins/ComfyStream/Intermediate/`

2. **Restart and try again:**
   - Restart your computer
   - Open Visual Studio
   - Build → Clean Solution
   - Build → Rebuild Solution

### Solution 5: Use Unreal Editor Build
Instead of Visual Studio, try building through Unreal Editor:
1. Open Unreal Editor
2. Go to Tools → Refresh Visual Studio Project Files
3. Close Unreal Editor
4. Open Visual Studio and build

## Quick Fix (Try This First)
1. **Restart your computer**
2. **Close all unnecessary applications**
3. **Try building again**

## If Still Failing
The issue might be that your system doesn't have enough RAM. Unreal Engine compilation is very memory-intensive. Consider:
- Adding more RAM to your system
- Using a machine with more memory for compilation
- Building only the plugin instead of the entire project

## Expected Result
After increasing virtual memory and restarting, the compilation should succeed without memory errors.
