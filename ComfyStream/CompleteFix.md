# Complete Fix for ComfyStream Struct Warnings

## The Problem
The `LIVECODING_ComfyStreamConfig_0` warnings persist because Unreal Engine's Live Coding system can't properly migrate the struct changes. This happens when you modify USTRUCT definitions during development.

## Complete Solution

### Step 1: Clean Everything
1. **Close Unreal Editor completely**
2. **Delete these folders:**
   ```
   Binaries/
   Intermediate/
   Saved/
   Plugins/ComfyStream/Binaries/
   Plugins/ComfyStream/Intermediate/
   ```

### Step 2: Force Complete Rebuild
1. **Delete the entire plugin folder temporarily:**
   - Move `Plugins/ComfyStream/` to a backup location
2. **Open Unreal Editor** (it will complain about missing plugin, that's OK)
3. **Close Unreal Editor**
4. **Restore the plugin folder** from backup
5. **Right-click on `Reconstruction_3D.uproject`**
6. **Select "Generate Visual Studio project files"**

### Step 3: Alternative - Create New Plugin
If the warnings persist, create a fresh plugin:

1. **Create new plugin:**
   - In Unreal Editor: Edit → Plugins → Add → New Plugin
   - Name: `ComfyStreamNew`
   - Copy all source files from old plugin

2. **Update references:**
   - Update any Blueprint references to use the new plugin
   - Update any C++ includes

### Step 4: Nuclear Option - Reset Project
If all else fails:

1. **Create a new Unreal project**
2. **Copy your content** (maps, assets, etc.)
3. **Copy the fixed plugin** to the new project
4. **Test the plugin** in the clean environment

## What We've Fixed

✅ **Struct Redirects**: Added proper redirects for Live Coding
✅ **Migration Function**: Added `MigrateFromOldVersion()` to handle struct changes
✅ **Safe Initialization**: All new properties have safe defaults
✅ **Bounds Checking**: Polling frequency is clamped to safe values

## Expected Result

After following these steps:
- ❌ No more `LIVECODING_ComfyStreamConfig_0` warnings
- ✅ Plugin works without crashes
- ✅ Images stream properly from ComfyUI
- ✅ All struct properties initialize correctly

## If Warnings Still Appear

The warnings are **cosmetic** and won't affect functionality. Your plugin will work correctly even with the warnings. The warnings will disappear when you:
- Package the project for distribution
- Create a new project with the plugin
- Use the plugin in a clean environment

## Test Your Plugin

1. Create a ComfyStreamActor in your level
2. Set the server URL to your ComfyUI server
3. Press Play
4. You should see images streaming without crashes
